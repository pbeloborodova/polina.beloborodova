abstract: "Research on mindfulness is booming, but the validity of its self-report measures is questioned. Psychometric network analysis showed that Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire subscales were more closely connected with other constructs than among themselves; thus the scale measures mindfulness-related constructs rather than a unique construct. More research on mindfulness assessment is needed."
