summary: "In this study, we qualitatively investigated college students’ perceptions of calling in Russia, the country whose culture is often said to combine the traits of both Western and Eastern cultures. They saw it as something more than a mere job, were intrinsically motivated to find it and dedicate themselves to it, associated calling with the usage of their abilities, and at the same time expected it to make them more energized and bring success without considerable effort."
abstract: "The definition of calling was reflected in six themes: intrinsic motivation, success, more than a job, dedication, ability and energy influx. Positive affect, success, purpose, and interest were the most prominent indicators of calling, mentioned by more than a quarter of the respondents. Only 10% of the respondents identified a specific area or profession, which they believed to be their calling. The majority of the respondents described their callings in abstract terms (to provide benefit, to make the world a better place, to be happy), or indicated, that they were searching for it. Search for calling included observable activity aimed at exploration of different areas, as well as internal activity comprised of self-reflection and self-development."
