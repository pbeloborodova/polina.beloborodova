abstract: "Research community and general public are increasingly interested in the concept of career calling. However, the psychological mechanisms of its discernment remain obscure. The present research addresses this gap by examining temporal relations between calling, life meaning, and personal life position, as well as testing an intervention aimed at helping college students to discern their callings. The results suggest that calling is developed rather than discovered, and its developments can be facilitated by an intervention."
