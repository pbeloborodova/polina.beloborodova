abstract: In 2013 Martin Seligman and his team organized a conference in Kent, United Kingdom where they invited prominent religious and secular scholars who investigated the concept of calling in their works. Following the conference, a book called Being Called, Scientific, secular and sacred perspectives was published (2015). The book includes chapters on the religious and philosophical roots of the concept of calling, as well as contemporary research in the fields of psychology and nueroscience.
