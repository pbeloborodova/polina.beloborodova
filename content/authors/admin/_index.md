Polina is a PhD Candidate in Social Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University, working with <a href= "https://psychology.vcu.edu/people/faculty/brown.html">Dr. Kirk Warren Brown</a>. After earning a BS in Management at HSE University (Moscow, Russia) and a double MS, also in Management, at HSE University and ESCP Europe (Paris, France), she started her career in business. However, Polina eventually found her calling in psychology research, completed a PhD in Psychology from HSE University under the guidance of <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/28125914">Dr. Dmitry A. Leontiev</a> and is currently working toward her second, quantitative research methods-focused PhD at VCU.

Polina served as Research Assistant for <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/about/people/ryan-niemiec">Dr. Ryan Niemiec</a> at the VIA Institute on Character, <a href="https://www.naropa.edu/profile/ivtzan-itai/">Dr. Itai Ivtzan</a> at Naropa University, and <a href="https://psych.vcu.edu/about/meet-our-team/james-m-bjork-phd.html">Dr. James Bjork</a> at the VCU Decision Neuroscience Lab. While at HSE University, she also built and headed the Career Service at the International College of Economics and Finance.

Polina's research interests lie in the intersection of contemplative science and positive psychology. Polina's upcoming dissertation study funded by the <a href="https://www.mindandlife.org/grant/effects-and-mechanisms-of-smartphone-based-mindfulness-training-on-emotional-well-being-in-at-risk-college-students/">Mind & Life Francisco J. Varela Grant</a> will explore the effects of a smartphone-based mindfulness training on college students' emotional well-being using the data collected via daily surveys, smartphone sensors, and interviews. In her free time, Polina enjoys reading Russian classics, spending time in nature, and taking long walks around historical neighborhoods of Richmond.
